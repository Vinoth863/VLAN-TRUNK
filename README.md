# VLAN-MULTI SWITCH TRUNK
# DEFINITION
A VLAN trunk is a network link that carries traffic for multiple VLANs between switches or between a switch and a router. Trunk links use tagging protocols, such as IEEE 802.1Q, to identify which VLAN each frame belongs to, enabling inter-VLAN communication over a single physical connection.

# PROJECT DEFINITION
 A VLAN trunk link was configured between the two LAN areas to allow multiple VLANs to pass through the same interface. The trunk carried VLAN2 and VLAN3 so that devices assigned to the same VLAN in both LAN segments could communicate across the network.
