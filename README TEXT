# VLAN-TRUNK
# DEFINICTION
A VLAN trunk is a network link that carries traffic for multiple VLANs between switches or between a switch and a router. Trunk links use tagging protocols, such as IEEE 802.1Q, to identify which VLAN each frame belongs to, enabling inter-VLAN communication over a single physical connection.

# PROJECT DEFINITION
A VLAN trunk link was established between the network (192.168.0.0/24) two switches to carry multiple VLANs across the connection. Both switches were configured with the same VLAN IDs (VLAN 2 and VLAN 3) to ensure seamless VLAN traffic forwarding and proper inter-switch communication for the connected devices.

# SWITCH CLI-COMMANDS

**1.SWITCH TO SWITCH**

Switch (config)#int fa 0/5

Switch (config - if)# switchport mode access

Switch (config - if# switchport mode trunk

**2.VLAN CLI COMMAND**

Switch (config# int fa 0/1

Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access

Switch(config-if)# switchport access van 2

**(SAME FOR VLAN COMMAND ALL DEVICES)**
